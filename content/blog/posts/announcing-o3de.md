## Announcing Open 3D Engine

On July 6th, 2021, the Linux Foundation announced the public availability of the **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** open-source project and the formation of the Open 3D Foundation.

As a founding partner in O3DE, Amazon Web Services and the AWS Lumberyard team has been working on this effort for awhile, preparing the code and tools for a developer-centric initial release. Curious about the work? Read these AWS Game Tech blog posts that they published earlier in 2021, describing the new features they are building out for O3DE.

* [Announcing Open 3D Engine (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/open-3d-engine/). Amar Mehta, General Manager of AWS Lumberyard, and Royal O'Brien, Principal Solutions Architect, discuss O3DE and why AWS supports this open-source effort.

* [Splitting the Atom: Introducing Lumberyard's New Photorealistic Renderer](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/splitting-the-atom-introducing-lumberyards-new-photorealistic-renderer/). In this post, Chanelle Mosquera and Doug Erickson, AWS Lumberyard programming writers, run down the basics of the new Atom renderer.

* [The Future of the Lumberyard Build System](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/lumberyard-build-system/). Let one of AWS Lumberyard's talented engineers, Esteban Papp, guide you through the development of the new CMAKE build system.

* [Clearing the first hurdle: Python Asset Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/clearing-the-first-hurdle-python-asset-builder/). Here, AWS Lumberyard programming writer Mike Cronin gives you the lowdown on O3DE's Python Asset Builder and manufacturing destructible NVIDIA Blast assets.

* [Building a Smarter Foundation: Math Improvements in Lumberyard](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/building-a-smarter-foundation-math-improvements-in-lumberyard/) and [Lumberyard Math Libraries: Accuracy Improvements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/lumberyard-math-libraries-accuracy-improvements/). It's a two-parter! First, AWS Lumberyard principal engineer Karl Berg drops a high-level overview of the math library changes; and then senior engineer David Greer finishes up with a quick primer on optimizations for accuracy.

* [The Journey to Prefabs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/the-journey-to-prefabs/). Let AWS Lumberyard UX designer Josh Rainbolt gently guide you through the fraught history of "slices" and how the team finally came around to proper prefabs. Spoiler alert: it involves customers!

* [Building Battle-Tested Network Transport](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/building-battle-tested-network-transport/). AWS Lumberyard Senior Engineer Rajiv Puvvada covers the new AzNetworking Gem, and shares some code and performance stats.

And check out what other O3DE partners are saying, as well!

* [Tafi](https://www.maketafi.com/) tells us why this engine is a good fit for their avatar and character solutions in [How Tafi is Democratizing Avatar and Character Solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/how-tafi-is-democratizing-avatar-and-character-solutions/)

* [Carbonated Studios](https://www.carbonated.com/) discusses why Script Canvas is critical to how they deliver their upcoming game, Madworld, in [Unleashing the power of the Carbonated Studios team](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/unleashing-the-power-of-the-carbonated-studios-team/).
