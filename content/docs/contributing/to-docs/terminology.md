**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** has many unique and specialized terms. This topic explains these terms and how documentation contributors should use them.

## General terminology guidance

* Always capitalize the proper names of tools, Gems, and components.
* Use **Bold** text for the first on-page reference of a tool, Gem, or component proper name.
* Use regular text for subsequent references to a tool, Gem, or component proper name.
* Introduce acronyms in their expanded form followed by the acronym in parentheses. For example, "console variable (cvar)".
* Use the acronym for subsequent on-page references.
* Be consistent in the use of O3DE terms. For example, use "level" rather than "scene", and use "Perspective" rather than "viewport".

## O3DE specific terms

O3DE specific terms are defined in the table below, with guidance for documentation contributors. Use these terms and styles consistently throughout the O3DE documentation.

| Term | Variations | Explanation and Usage |
|-|-|-|
| actor | *\<none\>* | A specialized type of entity that has an **Actor** component. Actors can use key-frame animation and/or are capable of receiving input. Do not capitalize this term when referring to actor entity types in general. When referring to the named component, capitalize the term "Actor" and use bold text for the first on-page reference. |
| AMD TressFX | *\<none\>* | A set of tools and an SDK for creating simulated realistic hair and fur. AMD TressFX is a product name and trademark. Each letter of the word "AMD" must be capitalized, and the letters "T", "F", and "X" in "TressFX" must be capitalized. Use the complete term "AMD TressFX" when referring to the product and related technology provided by AMD and the GPUOpen project. |
| **Animation Editor** | *\<none\>* | A tool for creating **Anim Graphs**, specialized collision, and physics simulations for actor entities. Always capitalize both "Animation" and "Editor", as this is a tool name, and a proper noun. Use bold text for the first on-page reference. |

| **Anim Graph** | *\<none\>* | An interactive graph of animated behavior for actors in the **Animation Editor**. This is a compound of "animation" and "graph". Always capitalize "Anim" and "Graph", as it is a tool name, and a proper noun. Use bold text for the first on-page reference. |
| animation graph | anim graph| The product asset (`.animgraph`) of the Anim Graph tool; a flow graph that switches and blends animation states based on inputs and other events. Do not capitalize the terms "animation graph" or "anim graph" in this context. |
| **Atom Renderer** | Atom | O3DE's renderer. Always capitalize both "Atom" and "Renderer" as it is a proper noun. Use "**Atom Renderer**" in bold text for the first on-page reference. Use "Atom" in regular text for subsequent references. |
| canvas | | A container and virtual surface for the layout of scripted logic, components, or UI widgets. Canvases are used by **Script Canvas**, **Landscape Canvas**, **UI Editor**, and many other tools in O3DE. Because this is an overloaded term, you should reference canvases by their type or extension when referring to files or assets. Only use the generic term "canvas" in tutorials where the context is obvious, in reference to the virtual canvas surface on which nodes are placed. Donâ€™t capitalize the term "canvas" in this context. |
| component | *\<none\>* | An element that can be added to an entity to provide specific functionality. Don't capitalize the term "component". Limit use of the term "component" to the context of the Component Entity System. |
| Component Entity System | CES | A model for creating complex objects with behaviors wherein components that provide specific functionality are added to reusable entities. Always capitalize the words "Component", "Entity", and "System", and each letter in the acronym "CES", when referring to O3DE's implementation of this concept. Use "**Component Entity System (CES)**" in bold for the first on-page reference. Use "CES" in regular text for subsequent references. |
| **Console** | *\<none\>* | A tool for setting console variables, entering commands, and executing scripts. Always capitalize "Console", when referring to the O3DE Editor Console, as this is a tool name, and a proper noun. Use bold text for the first on-page reference. |
