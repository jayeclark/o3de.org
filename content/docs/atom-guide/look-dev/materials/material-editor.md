The **Material Editor** is a standalone application that allows artists to view, edit, and create new materials. This section introduces the Material Editor and describes the editor layout and its individual panels.

## Quick Start
To get started, launch the Material Editor and create or edit a material. 

#### Launch the Material Editor
You can launch the Material Editor from the **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** Editor, or as a standalone application:   

- From the O3DE Editor, you can launch Material Editor in two ways.
  
  - Select **Main Menu > Tools > Material Editor**.
  
  - From a Material component in the Inspector, select **Edit Material in Material Editor...** in the hamburger menu of a material assignment slot.

- As a standalone application, launch the executable `<build>\bin\profile\MaterialEditor.exe`.

#### Create or edit a material
You can create a new material or edit an existing material from the File menu in the Material Editor, or from the Context menu in the Asset Browser: 

- From the File menu in the Material Editor:
  
  - To create a new material, choose **New** and choose a material type for the new material.
  
  - To open an existing material, choose **Open...** or **Open Recent**, and select an existing material.

- From the Context menu in the Asset Browser:
  
  1. Select a `.material` file.
 
  2. Then, right-click the `.material` file to open the context menu.
  
  3. Choose **Open in Material Editor...** to open the material in the Material Editor.

## Viewport
Use the **Viewport** panel to preview opened materials. To preview materials in various environments, configure the 3D model and lighting setup (see the [Viewport Toolbar](#viewport-toolbar) and [Viewport Settings](#viewport-settings) sections below).

### Material Viewport Tabs
Each opened material is contained in its own Viewport Tab, allowing you to edit multiple materials at once. This is useful for editing the materials of complex assets, such as characters or vehicles, since they are often made of multiple materials.

You can switch tabs to edit different materials; this will change the properties and settings in the Inspector and the Viewport Toolbar. You can reorder tabs, but you can't undock them from the Viewport. 

{{< note >}}
The Viewport cannot be closed entirely. If all the tabs are closed, the Viewport shows a default scene that contains a blank model, ground, and natural light.

{{< /note >}}  

## Inspector
In the **Inspector**, you can configure the properties for the active material. The **Details** group shows the material's material type and optional parent material properties. All other property groups depend on the material type and are defined in the `.materialtype` file. See the [Material Type Reference](/docs/atom-guide/look-dev/materials/material-type-file-spec/) for all the material types in Atom and the property groups in each. 

## Asset Browser
The **Asset Browser** allows you to search for assets across O3DE, Gems, and other project folders. In the Material Editor, the Asset Browser is automatically filtered to show image and material assets. You can display more assets by changing the filter. When an asset is selected, a preview of the asset is shown on the side. 

## Python Terminal
With the **Python Terminal**, you can run Python commands to modify, import, and process various assets that the Material Editor uses, such as shaders, textures, and materials. 

## Performance Monitor
The **Performance Monitor** provides an overview of the Material Editor's run-time performance. It displays the frame rate, and the GPU and CPU frame times. This is useful to gauge the CPU and GPU performance of materials and assets.
