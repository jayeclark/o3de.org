**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** **Lua Editor** (Lua IDE) offers an intuitive integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easy to author, debug, and edit Lua scripts when you create or extend your game. Lua Editor is a standalone application, but you can open it directly in **O3DE Editor** from the Tools menu.

This tutorial shows you how to use O3DE Lua Editor to perform debugging operations on a sample script.

## Add sample Lua Script to an entity

1. Open Lua Editor from the **Tools** menu.  

1. Select **New** from the **File** menu to create a new Lua script.

1. **Copy** and **Paste** the following code into the new script.

    ```lua
    -- ConstantRotation.lua
    
    local ConstantRotation =
    {
        Properties =
            {
            Rotation = { default = Vector3(0, 0, 90), description = "Constant rotation (in degrees) to apply over time." },
            },
    }

    function ConstantRotation:OnActivate()
        self.rotationRadians = self.Properties.Rotation;
        self.rotationRadians.x = Math.DegToRad(self.rotationRadians.x);
        self.rotationRadians.y = Math.DegToRad(self.rotationRadians.y);
        self.rotationRadians.z = Math.DegToRad(self.rotationRadians.z);
        self.tickBusHandler = TickBus.Connect(self)
    end

    function ConstantRotation:OnTick(deltaTime, timePoint)
        TransformBus.Event.RotateAroundLocalX(self.entityId, self.rotationRadians.x * deltaTime);
        TransformBus.Event.RotateAroundLocalY(self.entityId, self.rotationRadians.y * deltaTime);
        TransformBus.Event.RotateAroundLocalZ(self.entityId, self.rotationRadians.z * deltaTime);
    end

    function ConstantRotation:OnDeactivate()
        self.tickBusHandler:Disconnect()
    end

    return ConstantRotation
    ```
    
1. **Save** the script as `ConstantRotation.lua` in your project's directory.

1. **Close** Lua Editor.

1. In **Entity Outliner**, choose an entity to add a **Lua Script** component to.

1. In **Entity Inspector**, choose **Add Component**, and then choose **Scripting**, **Lua Script**.

1. In **Entity Inspector**, locate the **Lua Script** component, and then choose the **Pick Lua Script** button next to the empty **Script** field.

    ![Open the Pick Lua Script window from the Lua Script component](/images/user-guide/scripting/lua/lua-component-pick-lua-script.png)
    
1. In the **Pick Lua Script** window, select `ConstantRotation.lua` and choose **OK**.

1. In the **Lua Script** component, choose the **Open in Lua Editor** button to launch Lua Editor.

## Connect to O3DE Editor with GridHub

Connection is facilitated by **GridHub**, which is O3DE's central connection hub for debugging. GridHub starts automatically when Lua Editor is started and must be running in the background for Lua Editor to find targets it can connect to.  Because the debugging functionality is enabled through network sockets, you must connect Lua Editor to the target that is running the script before you can debug. In this tutorial, you connect to O3DE Editor.

1. In the Lua Editor toolbar, choose **Target: None**, and then choose **Editor(*ID*)** to connect to O3DE Editor.

    ![Target selector](/images/user-guide/scripting/lua/lua-editor-debugger-target-editor.png)
    
    {{< note >}}
You may need to expand the Lua Editor window to see the buttons on the Lua Editor toolbar for the next few steps.
{{< /note >}}

1. In the Lua Editor toolbar, leave **Context** setting at **Default** for the debugging context. The default setting is good for debugging component entity scripts such as the one in this tutorial.

    ![Context selector](/images/user-guide/scripting/lua/lua-editor-debugger-context-choose.png)

1. The **Debugging** icon turns green to show that Lua Editor and O3DE Editor are connected:

    ![Lua Editor connected to O3DE Editor](/images/user-guide/scripting/lua/lua-editor-debugger-connected-icon.png)

    Click **Classes** in the **Class Reference** to show the available Lua libraries. You can do the same for **EBuses** and **Globals**.
    
    {{< note >}}
You may need to switch focus to O3DE Editor before Class Reference will populate.

    {{< note >}}
The class reference feature is active only for the default context and component entity scripts.

## Setting breakpoints

After you connect, you can pause a script by setting breakpoints.

1. In the Lua Editor toolbar, click the **Breakpoints** icon ![Breakpoints Icon](/images/user-guide/scripting/lua/lua-editor-debugger-breakpoints-icon.png) to show the **Breakpoints** window.

1. In Lua Editor, click one or more line numbers in the `constantrotation.lua` script to set one or more breakpoints. As you add breakpoints, the line number and script path for each are added to the **Breakpoints** window.

1. In O3DE Editor, press **Ctrl+G** to run the game, or click the **Simulate** icon at the bottom of the viewport to enable game simulation and run scripts. Lua Editor opens with a yellow marker stopped on the first breakpoint that it encounters.

    ![Debugger stopped on breakpoint](/images/user-guide/scripting/lua/lua-editor-debugger-stopped-on-breakpoint.png)

    When execution is halted at a breakpoint, more information becomes available in the **Lua Locals**, **Stack**, and **Watched Variables** panes.

1. Click the **Stack** icon ![Stack Icon](/images/user-guide/scripting/lua/lua-editor-debugger-stack-icon.png) to show the **Stack** window.

1. Click the **Lua Locals** icon ![Lua Locals Icon](/images/user-guide/scripting/lua/lua-editor-debugger-lua-locals-icon.png) to show local Lua variables.

1. Click **Watched Variables** icon ![Watched Variables Icon](/images/user-guide/scripting/lua/lua-editor-debugger-watched-variables-icon.png) to open the **Watched Variables** window, where you can specify variables to watch.

1. Press **F11** a few times to step through the code. Note how the contents of the **Stack**, **Lua Locals**, and **Watched Variables** windows change.

For greater convenience, you can float or dock these windows.

1. To detach from debugging, click **Debugging**.

    ![Click to detach from debugging](/images/user-guide/scripting/lua/lua-editor-debugger-detach-icon.png)

1. In O3DE Editor, Press **Esc** to stop the game.
