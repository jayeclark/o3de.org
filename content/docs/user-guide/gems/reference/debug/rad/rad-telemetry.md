RAD Telemetry is an instrumentation-based profiling and performance visualization middleware product created by [RAD Game Tools](http://www.radgametools.com/telemetry.htm). The RAD Telemetry Gem provides a RAD Telemetry integration for **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** for those who have licensed RAD Telemetry.

The RAD Telemetry Gem provides one example of how to integrate instrumentation-based profiling middleware. You could write a gem for your own instrumentation-based profiler and leverage O3DE's existing performance markers. See the Profiler.h file in the /Code/Framework/AzCore/AzCore/Debug directory to see how the RAD Telemetry Gem ties into O3DE's existing performance markers.

If the RAD Telemetry Gem is disabled or you do not have the RAD redistributable files for a particular target platform, the performance instrumentation compiles to O3DE's performance markers.

**Enabling the RAD Telemetry Gem**

1. Extract the Telemetry redistributables from RAD Game Tools to /Gems/RADTelemetry/External. You should see the following subdirectories, which match the subdirectories provided by RAD:

    * `Dll`
    * `Lib`
    * `Include`
    * `Docs`

{{< note >}}
If you are compiling on case-sensitive host platforms, note that the first letter of each subdirectory listed above is capitalized.

When compiling a project with the RAD Telemetry Gem enabled, the static lib file for the target platform must exist in the `Gems\RADTelemetry\External\Lib` directory. The build system then compiles with the `AZ_PROFILE_TELEMETRY` defined globally and links RAD Telemetry libraries for the specified target platform. You can add additional target platforms by editing the `rad_telemetry.json` file located in the `Gems\RADTelemetry\3rdParty directory`.

2. Extract RAD Telemetry Tools to the `/Gems/RADTelemetry/Tools` directory. This should include `telemetry.exe` and your license file from RAD.

    Enable the RAD Telemetry Gem for your project.

    Build your project. You must build using profile (preferred) or debug in order to enable RAD Telemetry.

**Instrumenting Your Code**

With the RAD Telemetry Gem, Lumberyard introduces a set of scoped performance markers:

* `AZ_PROFILE_FUNCTION` – Instruments entire functions. Automatically names the performance event with the function's name.
* `AZ_PROFILE_SCOPE` – Instruments a local scope within a function of interest. You must provide the name.
* `AZ_PROFILE_SCOPE_DYNAMIC` – Instruments a `printf` style format string to dynamically generate a performance event name. Use the dynamic name sparingly because there may be performance overhead of a string copy and transmission over the network.

A scoped performance marker constructs an object that calls a start event and calls a stop event when it is destroyed. This means that you do not have to worry about early returns. We recommend that you use the `AZ_PROFILE` events when marking up your code, as it allows you to switch to Driller for a different view of profiling data.

**Capturing with RAD Telemetry**

See the [RAD Telemetry documentation](http://www.radgametools.com/telemetry.htm) for more information. The basic procedure is described below:

1. Set the console variables for the RAD Telemetry capture using either a configuration file or by entering them into the console at runtime.

1. All RAD Telemetry console variables start with `radtm_`. For example, `radtm_Address` and` radtm_Port` if your Telemetry server is on another machine. The console variables are defined in the `RADTelemetryModule.cpp` file. You can augment these console variables to better suit profiling for your title.

1. Use either `telemetry.exe` or the standalone telemetry server to start your RAD Telemetry server.

1. Run `radtm_ToggleEnabled` to begin a capture. You can also set this from the command line when launching your application with `+radtm_ToggleEnabled`.

1. Run `radtm_ToggleEnabled` again from the console or the remote console, or shut down your game process to end the session. As currently instrumented, captures can get large quickly, so you may want to perform focused captures around performance scenarios of interest (under 30 seconds in length).

1. Use the Telemetry visualizer, `telemetry.exe`, to analyze your capture.
