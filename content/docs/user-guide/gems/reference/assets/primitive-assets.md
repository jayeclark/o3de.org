The Primitive Assets Gem provides primitive shape assets that have physics enabled. Each asset is unit size (scale X: `1.0`,  Y: `1.0`, Z: `1.0`) and has a gray checkerboard texture. The checkerboard texture is RGB middle gray (R: `127`, G: `127`, B: `127`) and sRGB middle gray (R: `187`, G: `187`, B: `187`). Diffuse, normal, and specular maps are included. The primitive shape assets have import settings and materials. You can use these to add cube, sphere, and cylinder primitive shape assets to your level to use as placeholders, or test **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** Editor features.

The asset files for the primitive shape meshes are in the `\Gems\PrimitiveAssets\Assets` directory.
