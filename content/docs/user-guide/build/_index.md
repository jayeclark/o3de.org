To support multiple native build toolchains, **Open 3D Engine** (O3DE) uses the [CMake build tools](https://cmake.org/). While most configurable build systems make it difficult to work cross-platform, CMake is intentionally designed to take generic configuration files and generate toolchain-specific project files, and then perform native builds.

 Once you've [registered O3DE](/docs/welcome-guide/setup) and [created a project](/docs/welcome-guide/create), you can build your project with these commands:

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Windows" codelang="cmd">}}cd <project-directory>
mkdir build\windows
cmake -B build/windows -S . -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=<absolute-path-to-packages>
cmake --build build/windows --config profile --target <ProjectName>.GameLauncher Editor -- /m
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Linux" codelang="bash">}}cd <project-directory>
mkdir -p build/linux
cmake -B build/linux -S . -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=<absolute-path-to-packages>
cmake --build build/linux --config profile --target <ProjectName>.ServerLauncher Editor
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Builds created with these commands are located in the `<project-directory>/<build-dir>/bin/<platform>/profile` directory.

O3DE requires CMake {{< versions/cmake >}} or higher.
