To help you on your journey with **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)**, we offer samples that demonstrate fully self-contained O3DE projects, levels, or Gems that are meant to be used as starting points or playgrounds for experimentation.<!-- If you're a developer focused on finding smaller, quick, standalone examples, you should check out the [O3DE Cookbooks](/docs/learning-guide/cookbooks) for things like C++ samples, Script Canvas functions, and more.-->
