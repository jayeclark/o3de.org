## Before you get started

## Contributing to Documentation

### Reporting Documentation Issues

o3de.org uses GitHub Issues to track documentation issues and requests. If you see a documentation issue, submit an issue using the following steps:

1. Check the [o3de.org issues list](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org/issues) to see if your issue is already reported.
2. Use the [included template for every new issue](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org/issues/new).  When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible. If you have a suggestion for a fix already, submit it as a pull request!

Note that code issues should be filed against the main O3DE repository, while documentation issues should go in the o3de.org repository.

### Submitting Documentation Pull Requests

If you're fixing an issue in the existing documentation, you should submit a PR against the master branch. Follow [these instructions to create a documentation pull request against the o3de.org repository](https://o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-docs/submit-a-pr/).
